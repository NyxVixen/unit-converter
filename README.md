***Unit Converter***

This app was made as a project through the Scrimba frontend developer path. You should be able to type a numeric value into the input box and receive an output once you click the "convert" button.
You should be able to see *meters to feet*, *gallons to liters*, *pounds to kilos*, and vice versa after clicking the button.
